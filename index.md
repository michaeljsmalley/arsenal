## What's `arsenal` about?

This is a place where I maintain the inventory of all of the tools, utilities, and even gimmicky binaries I've stumbled upon and used to some extent over the years. Like most things I put up on [my GitHub](https://github.com/michaeljsmalley) or [the blog](www.smalleycreative.com), it serves two purposes:

* Personal benefit: It's nice keeping all of the tools I've come across in an organized place it here so I don't need to remember it
* Community benefit: It's nice sharing this mess with humanity. ðŸ˜€
