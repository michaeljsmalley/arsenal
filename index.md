## What's `arsenal` about?

This is a place where I maintain the inventory of all of the tools, utilities, and even gimmicky binaries I've stumbled upon and used to some extent over the years. It serves two purposes:

* Personal benefit: It's nice keeping all of the tools I've come across in an organized place it here so I don't need to remember it, part community contribution.
* Community benefit: It's nice sharing this mess with humanity. ðŸ˜€
